# Final Module 2 Evaluation Exercise

This exercise evaluates the knowledge we have acquired throughout Module 2 of the Web Development Bootcamp at [Adalab](https://adalab.es). To complete it, we had to create a page that displays a list of Disney characters from an API. These characters can be selected to be displayed in a list of favorites, and can be alternatively added or deleted. Also, the main list of characters can be filtered by their names to search for the characters you prefer. 

This exercise demonstrates our skills in web development and data manipulation through an interactive interface and is integrated into the Starter Kit project template provided by Adalab and created in **node and vite**.

What did I use in the exercise?

- HTML
- CSS, Sass
- JavaScript
